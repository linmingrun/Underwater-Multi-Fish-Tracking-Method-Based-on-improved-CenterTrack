## Abstract

Multi-object fish tracking is crucial for evaluating the health and growth
conditions of farmed fish in aquaculture. This study proposes an improved
CenterTrack model tailored for underwater environments, addressing chal-
lenges such as occlusions, rapid movements, and similar visual appearances.
By integrating a Multi-Scale Attention Dynamic Weighted (MADW) mod-
ule and an Occlusion-Aware Head (OAHead), our method enhances feature
extraction and tracking robustness. A new loss function and a three-stage
cascade matching strategy further improve accuracy. Experimental results
on the MF25 dataset demonstrate superior performance with 82.5% IDF1,
85.8% MOTA, and 84.7% IDP, showcasing the potential of our approach
for industrial-scale aquaculture surveillance.
